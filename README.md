# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Things I would like to added :
Typescript
Unit Test Cases

Assumptions:Tested on my local machine hence not optimized for hosting etc
